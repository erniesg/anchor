### 2. ✅ RBAC System Design & Schema Implementation

**Complete role-based access control with draft/submit workflow**

#### Schema Changes

**User Roles**:
```
family_admin   → Account owner, full permissions
family_member  → Co-viewer, read-only access
caregiver      → Form submitter (existing, enhanced)
```

**New/Updated Tables**:
1. **`users`** (updated):
   - Roles: `family_admin`, `family_member`
   - Added: `active`, `deleted_at`, `email_notifications`, `sms_notifications`, `timezone`

2. **`care_recipients`** (updated):
   - Renamed: `family_id` → `family_admin_id` (explicit ownership)
   - Added: `timezone`

3. **`care_recipient_access`** (NEW):
   - Junction table for access control
   - Tracks which `family_member` users can access which care recipients
   - Fields: `care_recipient_id`, `user_id`, `granted_by`, `granted_at`, `revoked_at`

4. **`caregivers`** (updated):
   - Added: `email`, `deactivated_at`, `deactivated_by`, `deactivation_reason`
   - Added: `last_pin_reset_at`, `last_pin_reset_by`, `created_by`
   - Full audit trail for admin actions

5. **`care_logs`** (updated - DRAFT/SUBMIT WORKFLOW):
   - Added: `status` (draft|submitted|invalidated)
   - Added: `submitted_at`, `invalidated_at`, `invalidated_by`, `invalidation_reason`

#### Draft/Submit Workflow

```
┌─────────┐
│  draft  │ ← Auto-save every 30s, editable by caregiver
└────┬────┘
     │ Click "Submit"
     ▼
┌───────────┐
│ submitted │ ← Locked (immutable), visible to family
└─────┬─────┘
      │ family_admin clicks "Invalidate"
      ▼
┌──────────────┐
│ invalidated  │ ← Flagged for correction
└──────────────┘
```

**Files**:
- `packages/database/src/schema.ts` (updated with all new fields)
- `packages/database/drizzle/migrations/0001_add_rbac_and_draft_submit.sql` (90+ lines)
- `RBAC_SCHEMA_DESIGN.md` (400+ line specification)

**Commits**:

   ```tsx
   <InviteFamilyMember>
     Email: [input]
     Care Recipients: [multi-select checkboxes]
     [Send Invite]
   </InviteFamilyMember>

   <FamilyMembersList>

       [Edit Access] [Revoke Access]
     </FamilyMemberCard>
   </FamilyMembersList>
   ```

4. **Profile Settings**:
   ```tsx
   <ProfileSettings>
     Name: [input]
     Email: [input] (requires password confirmation)
     Phone: [input]
     Timezone: [select: IANA timezones]
     Notifications:
       ☑ Email notifications

### Phase 3: Caregiver Draft/Submit UI (After Admin UI)

**Caregiver Form Updates** (Estimated: 2 hours)

1. **Add Auto-Save**:
   ```typescript
   // Hook: useAutoSave.ts
   useEffect(() => {
     const interval = setInterval(() => {
       if (formData.status === 'draft') {
         saveDraft(formData);
       }
     }, 30000);
     return () => clearInterval(interval);
   }, [formData]);
   ```

2. **Add Submit Button**:
   ```tsx
   <FormFooter>
     {status === 'draft' && (
       <>
         <p>Auto-saved {lastSavedAt}</p>
         <Button onClick={handleSubmit}>Submit Report</Button>
       </>
     )}
     {status === 'submitted' && (
       <Alert>✅ Report submitted successfully</Alert>
     )}
   </FormFooter>
   ```

3. **Prevent Editing After Submit**:
   ```typescript
   const isLocked = careLog.status === 'submitted' || careLog.status === 'invalidated';
   const readOnly = isLocked;
   ```

**Files to Update**:
- `apps/web/src/routes/caregiver/care-log-form.tsx` (add auto-save, submit)
- `apps/web/src/hooks/use-auto-save.ts` (new)

---

### Phase 4: Dashboard Enhancements (Polish)

**Show Draft vs Submitted Status** (Estimated: 1 hour)

1. **Today View Badge**:
   ```tsx
   {todayLog.status === 'draft' && (
     <Badge color="yellow">Draft (In Progress)</Badge>
   )}
   {todayLog.status === 'submitted' && (
     <Badge color="green">✅ Submitted</Badge>
   )}
   {todayLog.status === 'invalidated' && (
     <Badge color="red">⚠️ Needs Correction</Badge>
   )}
   ```

2. **Week View Filtering**:
   ```typescript
   // Only show submitted logs in analytics
   const { data: weekLogs } = useQuery({
     queryFn: async () => {
       const logs = await fetchWeekLogs(weekDates);
       return logs.filter(log => log.status === 'submitted');
     }
   });
   ```

**Files to Update**:
- `apps/web/src/routes/family/dashboard.tsx` (add status badges, filter by status)

---

## 📝 Key Design Decisions Made

### 1. Draft/Submit Over Edit-After-Submit
**Decision**: Once submitted, care logs are immutable. Family admin can only invalidate.

**Rationale**:
- ✅ Medical/legal best practice (immutable records)
- ✅ Simpler implementation (no versioning)
- ✅ Clearer audit trail
- ✅ Prevents tampering

**Alternative Considered**: Edit-after-submit with full version history
- ❌ More complex (requires `care_log_history` table)
- ❌ Potential for tampering concerns
- ❌ Legal/compliance risks

---

### 2. Junction Table for Access Control
**Decision**: Created `care_recipient_access` table for explicit grants to `family_member`.

**Rationale**:
- ✅ Flexible (grant/revoke access per care recipient)
- ✅ Scalable (multiple family members, multiple care recipients)
- ✅ Audit trail (who granted, when)

**Alternative Considered**: Simple many-to-many with no audit
- ❌ No visibility into who granted access
- ❌ No revocation tracking

---

### 3. Timezone at User AND Care Recipient Level
**Decision**: Both `users` and `care_recipients` have timezone fields.

**Rationale**:
- ✅ Supports distributed families (family in NY, care recipient in Singapore)
- ✅ Each user sees times in their preferred timezone
- ✅ Source of truth is care recipient's timezone

**Alternative Considered**: Only user timezone
- ❌ Ambiguous when care recipient moves locations
- ❌ Confusing for families in different timezones

---

### 4. Soft Delete for All Entities
**Decision**: Use `deleted_at`, `deactivated_at`, `revoked_at` timestamps instead of hard deletes.

**Rationale**:
- ✅ Preserves historical data
- ✅ Supports "undo" actions
- ✅ Audit trail intact

**Alternative Considered**: Hard deletes
- ❌ Data loss
- ❌ No audit trail

---

## 🧪 Testing Strategy

### Schema Testing (Database Package)
```bash
# Test schema constraints
pnpm --filter @anchor/database test

# Tests to add:
- users.role must be family_admin or family_member
- care_logs.status must be draft, submitted, or invalidated
- Foreign key cascades work correctly
```

### API Testing (Integration Tests)
```bash
# Test RBAC middleware
pnpm --filter @anchor/api test:integration

# Tests to add:
- family_admin can access all endpoints
- family_member is blocked from admin-only endpoints
- caregiver can only access own drafts
- RLS works correctly (can't access other families' data)
```

### E2E Testing (Playwright)
```bash
# Test full user flows
pnpm test:e2e

# Tests to add:
- family_admin creates caregiver, resets PIN, deactivates
- family_admin invites family_member, grants access, revokes
- caregiver creates draft, submits, sees success
- family_admin invalidates log, caregiver sees flag
```

## 🚀 Session Achievements

✅ **Dashboard Complete**: 3-mode view with 4 trend charts
✅ **Schema Designed**: Full RBAC system with draft/submit
✅ **Migration Created**: 90+ line SQL migration
✅ **Documentation**: 1000+ lines of comprehensive specs
✅ **Commits**: 2 semantic commits with detailed messages
✅ **Seed Data**: 7 days of test data ready for testing

**Total LOC Written Today**: ~1500 lines
**Files Created/Modified**: 10 files
**Time Spent**: ~3 hours

---

## 💡 Key Insights

1. **Timezone Complexity**: Multi-timezone support is critical for global families. Implemented at both user and care recipient level.

2. **Immutability Wins**: Draft/submit workflow with immutable submitted logs is simpler and legally sound compared to edit-after-submit.

3. **Audit Everything**: Every admin action (PIN reset, deactivation, access grant) is tracked with `by` and `at` fields.

4. **RLS is Key**: Row-level security via `canAccessCareRecipient()` prevents data leaks across families.

5. **Soft Deletes Always**: Never hard delete. Always use `deleted_at`, `deactivated_at`, `revoked_at`.
