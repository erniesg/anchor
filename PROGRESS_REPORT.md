## 🔧 Technical Debt & Issues

### Critical Issues

1. **Form Submission Not Working**
   - E2E tests: 2/5 fail on submission
   - Form submits but success message doesn't appear
   - May be API response issue or state management
   - **Fix Needed**: Debug submit flow, check API response handling

2. **TypeScript Errors**
   - 100+ pre-existing type errors
   - Non-blocking for deployment
   - Primarily import type issues and test file types
   - **Fix Needed**: Address verbatimModuleSyntax issues, add missing type imports

### Navigation Issues (FIXED ✅)
- ~~Duplicate section 10 bug~~ → Fixed in commit 397d68c
- ~~Sections 4, 7, 8 navigation broken~~ → All fixed
- ~~Fluid Intake in wrong position~~ → Moved to section 30

### Performance Considerations
- Bundle size: 848KB (warning at 500KB)
- Should implement code splitting
- Consider lazy loading for sections
- Optimize for mobile (Cloudflare edge caching helps)
